Ediwir: Track people's equipment to keep an eye on general wealth and know how much to assign
    MC: so like, "I've given out 600 gold of gear this level to 4 players, so I need to give out 100 more gold worth of gear to keep pace."

    MC: and an expansion on this would be:
    MC: "Here's a list of items I can give that meets that requirement, and I can filter by traits and keywords"

    E: If it's for PF2, tracking item level could be more effective
