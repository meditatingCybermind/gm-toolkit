Ediwir: Track people's equipment to keep an eye on general wealth and know how much to assign
    MC: so like, "I've given out 600 gold of gear this level to 4 players, so I need to give out 100 more gold worth of gear to keep pace."

    MC: and an expansion on this would be:
    MC: "Here's a list of items I can give that meets that requirement, and I can filter by traits and keywords"

    E: If it's for PF2, tracking item level could be more effective

Jam: Reguarding secret rolls, I think for 1e especially, there should be a button that has the player roll their dice and show the results for if they'd rolled for all of their knowledge rolls simultaneously
    Because the player doesn't know if this thing is a "knowledge Planes" or a "knowledge nature" or a "knowledge arcana"
